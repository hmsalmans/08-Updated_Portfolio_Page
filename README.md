# 08-Updated_Portfolio


I tried to build a multi-pag portfolio. 
## Sections:
            3 Sections.

        3-MY PORTFOLIO.
        
All these sections of the project are inter-linked and can be navigated from one another. The navigation at the top as well as at bottom can be used for same purpose.  I  tried to make a lay out so in future I can replace that layout with my projects. Most of the classes are used from bootsrap, although I did linked my external css files to achieve certain desired changes. 
                
     One of the cool addition to the project was logo
     
     
   ## Responsiveness
   
   The project is made responsive for different types of user views and adjusts its parameters accordingly.  

   ## Video
   
   A video link is addded to kids picture alongside _blank attribute to play video in a separate
   window.
