# Homework_2
This is the 2nd week homework..

I tried to build a multi-pag application describing my portfolio. This is the first interactive project I have built.
# Sections:
This project has 3 sections.

        1_MY INFO
        
        2-CONTACT
        
        3-MY PORTFOLIO.
        
        All these sections of the project are inter-linked and can be navigated from one another. The navigation at the top as well as at bottom can be used for same purpose. As I havn't developed any projects, so my project/portfolio section is not well developed. but I did tried to make a lay out so in future I can replace that layout with my projects.Most of the classes are used from bootsrap, although I did linked my external css files to achieve certain desired changes. 
                
     One of the cool addition to the project was logo
     
     
   # Responsiveness
   
   The project is made responsive for different types of user views and adjusts its parameters accordingly.    
   # Video
   
   A video link is addded to kids picture alongside _blank attribute to play video in a separate
   window.
